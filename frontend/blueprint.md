# Store Listing Application Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the development plan for the Store Listing Application. The goal is to create a modern, user-friendly, and feature-rich platform for users to discover and explore stores. The application will also provide a dashboard for store owners to manage their listings and for administrators to oversee the platform.

## Implemented Features

### Initial Setup

*   **Project Structure:** A standard React project structure using Vite.
*   **Routing:** `react-router-dom` for navigation between pages.
*   **Components:**
    *   `NavBar`: A simple navigation bar with links to Home, Login, and Sign Up.
*   **Pages:**
    *   `HomePage`: A placeholder for the home page.
    *   `LoginPage`: A placeholder for the login page.
    *   `SignupPage`: A placeholder for the signup page.
    *   `AdminDashboard`: A placeholder for the admin dashboard.
    *   `StoreOwnerDashboard`: A placeholder for the store owner dashboard.

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Enhance the Home Page

1.  **Restructure the JSX in `HomePage.jsx`:**
    *   Add a hero section with a headline, a brief description, and a call-to-action button.
    *   Add a section to showcase featured stores.
2.  **Create `HomePage.css`:**
    *   Style the hero section with a modern and visually appealing design.
    *   Style the featured stores section with a clean and organized layout.
3.  **Update `HomePage.jsx` to import the new CSS file.**

### Phase 2: Implement User Authentication

1.  **Enhance the `LoginPage` and `SignupPage` components:**
    *   Create functional login and signup forms using `react-hook-form`.
    *   Implement user authentication with Firebase.
2.  **Update the `NavBar` component:**
    *   Show user-specific links (e.g., "Dashboard", "Logout") when a user is logged in.
    *   Hide the "Login" and "Sign Up" links when a user is logged in.

### Phase 3: Develop the Store Owner Dashboard

1.  **Create a form for store owners to add and edit their store information.**
2.  **Display a list of the store owner's stores.**
3.  **Implement functionality to delete stores.**

### Phase 4: Develop the Admin Dashboard

2.  **Implement functionality to manage users and stores (e.g., approve/reject store listings, delete users).**

### Phase 5: Implement the Store Listing and Search Functionality

1.  **Create a page to display a list of all stores.**
2.  **Implement search and filtering functionality.**
3.  **Create a detail page for each store.**
